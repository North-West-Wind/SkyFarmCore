# Sky Farm (Mod)
This mod is basically the entire pack. Do not remove this from the pack. Things might break.
If you are looking for details about the pack, please visit the modpack's page.
[Here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sky-farm-stuff)'s its CurseForge page.

## Features
#### **Skyblock World Type**  
In the Create World Screen, you can go to more options and choose to generate your world as a Skyblock world.

#### **Parabox**  
You should know what this is if you have ever played Sky Factory 4. Unfortunately, Parabox has not been updated to newer versions since 1.12.2, so I just make this myself.
This is also designed to be compatible with [GameStages](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages).  

#### **Natural Evaporator**  
Basically another thing that holds recipes. At the start of the development of the pack, Tinker's Construct is not yet updated to 1.16, so this block is supposed to replace the drying rack.  

#### **Void Energy Generator**  
As the name suggests, this block generates energy from the void. In order to make it work, one must put the block directly above the void, with no blocks in between. This thing is pretty expensive, but it generates so much energy that basically overtakes any other generators.  

#### **Advancement Guide**  
This mod also include a lot of advancements to guide you through your Skyblock journey.  

#### **Faster Botany Pots Growth Rate**  
The growth rate of soils for Botany Pots is altered in this mod by quite a high amount. This allows faster growing for all crops in Botany Pots. But please note that Botany Pots is locked behind a stage.  

#### **Void/Sky/Axis Shifter**  
There is no way to create portals in the Skyblock world. Instead, you use different Shifters (which are all boots) to navigate to different dimensions.  

#### **TwerkItMeal**  
[TwerkItMeal](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/twerkitmeal) is directly included in the code of the mod, the reason being to allow modification of growth RNG.  

#### **ClearSkies**  
[ClearSkies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/clear-skies-forge-port) has not yet updated to 1.16.5, so I might just as well include it.  

#### **Custom Mekanism Fissile Fuel**
[Mekanism Generators](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism-generators) offers a fission reactor, which sadly only has 1 type of fuel. This mod adds another type of fuel to the fission reactor. The waste produced is the original squared, and the heat produced is the original cubed.

## Known Issues
#### **Parabox Item Rendering**  
When rendering items floating on top of a running Parabox, the item has no lighting. This will hopefully be fixed very soon.

## Modpack
~~Please DO NOT include this in other pack (except Sky Farm from me), though I might change my mind soon.~~
Feel free to include it in any CurseForge modpack!
